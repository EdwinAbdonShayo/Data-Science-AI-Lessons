        "- We have developed a logistic regression model on a simple dataset to predict whether a person will click on an ad (classification problem).\n",
        "- We then developed a random forest model and compared the findings to logistic regression. Random forest performed sligtly worse performance compared to logistic regression\n",
        "  - Normally, our expectation is that random forest should perform better. Why do you think it was not the case? Let us discuss this during the drop-in session.\n",
        "- We visualised decision-trees and practised on finding the best hyperparameter values.\n",
        "  - We still observed that only a slightly improvement was achieved, in some cases maybe no improvements were observed.\n",
        "- We interpreted the confusion matrix results and worked out the precision/recall calculations and compared our findings to the classification_report's.\n",
        "- Finally, we printed the most important features above a certain threshold."
